## My process

I had a problem with creating a credit card format in input, with help came the cleave.js library, it handled everything perfectly. The library also throws out the type of card as a value, I assigned it to the icons that are displayed on the sample card. I also tried to make the validation as error-free as possible, I also added some validation errors from myself that were not included in the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Cleave](https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/) - JS library
- PerfectPixel chrome addon

### What I learned
All the time I learn the basics of javascript, such projects help me to grow, I learned that ready-made libraries can work wonders, I also learned that 99% of the problems are found on stack-overflow :)
